## Project summary
The objective of PktPay is to develop html widget and react component which will make Seamless PKT Cash Accept On any Website
## Project Relevance to the PKT Network
Pkt Cash has been lacking proper options for individuals & small businesses to easily accept Pkt Cash on the web. Pkt Cash is meant to be used; it’s meant to be spent. While the Pkt Cash ecosystem is still in its infancy, it’s more important than ever to make it easy for those who are supporting the project to use it no matter their level of technical ability.

Right now, most businesses either roll their own solutions or rely on 3rd party (multi-coin) processors. We need something that individuals and smaller Pkt Cash-focused businesses can use that’s as simple as a static QR code but much more powerful.

We need to get Pkt Cash into the hands of as many people as possible. Making it dead simple to use is one of the key milestones we need to achieve to get us there. We still think that payments is the killer app that’s been overlooked by most cryptocurrency projects and it’s our goal to have PktPay play a key role in ensuring that Pkt Cash is the currency people think of first when they go to send money online.
